## Angle Bisector

The bisector of an angle is a ray that divides the angle into
two parts of equal size.

Any arbitrary point on the bisector is at an equal distance from
both sides of the angle.

In this simulation, the bisector has been drawn with red. You can
adjust the other side of the angle by dragging the blue dot.
