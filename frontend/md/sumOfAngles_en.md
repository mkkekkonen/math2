## Sum of Angles

The sum (max 360Â°) of two angles can be determined geometrically
by placing the two angles so that the vertices of the angles
and the right side of one angle and the left side of the other
angle are equal.

You can adjust the angles by dragging the colored dots in the
simulation.
