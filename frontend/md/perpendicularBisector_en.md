## Perpendicular Bisector

The perpendicular bisector of a line segment is a line, every point of which
is at an equal distance from the end points of the line segment.

On this page, the perpendicular bisector is calculated by turning both
end points of the line segment 90 degrees counter-clockwise. After that,
the line is drawn through those new points. The line is calculated and
drawn again every time one of the line segment's end points (blue in this
simulation) is moved with the mouse.
